## 🌟 What is This?

**FundMe** is a **DApp (Decentralized Application)** - think of it like a crowdfunding platform (similar to GoFundMe), but built on blockchain technology. Instead of relying on a central company to handle your donations, everything runs on the Ethereum network.

### 🎯 **What Makes This Special?**

- **No Middleman**: Direct peer-to-peer donations without banks or payment processors
- **Transparent**: Every transaction is publicly viewable on the blockchain
- **Global**: Anyone with internet can participate, no geographic restrictions
- **Secure**: Built on Ethereum's battle-tested security
- **Low Fees**: No platform fees, only small network costs
